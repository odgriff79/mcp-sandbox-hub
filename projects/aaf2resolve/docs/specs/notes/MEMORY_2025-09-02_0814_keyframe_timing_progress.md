# Memory Snapshot — AAF Keyframe Timing Progress

Context: Working on branch `keyframe-timing-implementation`

## Project Overview: AAF-to-FCPXML Keyframe Timing Implementation

### Current Status: BREAKTHROUGH - Detection Working, Pipeline Gap Identified

**Branch Context**: All keyframe timing work is on `keyframe-timing-implementation` branch
- Commit: 0e2d6ce (pushed to GitHub)
- Main branch unaffected - keyframe work isolated to feature branch

### Technical Achievements:
- **Specification Research**: Resolved AAF keyframe timing ambiguity through systematic AI challenge methodology
- **Timing Model**: Verified normalized 0.0-1.0 values per AAF Object Spec v1.1 §6.18-6.19  
- **Detection Fix**: Changed from 'points' to 'pointlist' attribute (648 parameters found)
- **Conversion Logic**: Implemented FCPXML seconds conversion formula

### Critical Discovery:
Direct parameter access confirms keyframe detection works:
- `Level` parameter: hasattr(pointlist)=False (static)
- `AFX_POS_X_U` parameter: hasattr(pointlist)=True, len=2 (animated with 2 keyframes)

### The Problem:
Pipeline gap between detection and output. Keyframes are detected but don't appear as "type": "animated" in final JSON.

### Next Steps:
1. Debug why `extract_keyframe_timing_data()` results aren't reaching final JSON
2. Verify parameter extraction pipeline calls keyframe functions properly  
3. Test end-to-end: keyframe detection → timing conversion → JSON serialization

### Repository State:
- **Main branch**: Clean, unaffected by keyframe work
- **Feature branch**: `keyframe-timing-implementation` with all progress
- **Integration**: Ready to merge once pipeline gap resolved

This represents major progress toward complete AAF keyframe timing support.
