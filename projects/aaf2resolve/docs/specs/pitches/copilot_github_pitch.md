## Overview
(then paste the full pitch text exactly as written)

Request for Input (No Code Yet)

I‚Äôve prepared a full specification repository for a project called aaf2resolve-spec:
üëâ https://github.com/odgriff79/aaf2resolve-spec

This repo defines a spec-first, JSON-first pipeline for converting Avid AAF sequences into FCPXML 1.13 compatible with DaVinci Resolve.

Key points you need to know from the repo:

Canonical JSON schema in /docs/data_model_json.md is the single source of truth.

Traversal, UMID resolution, and effect extraction rules are defined in /docs/inspector_rule_pack.md.

Authoritative-first UMID resolution is required: SourceClip ‚Üí MasterMob ‚Üí SourceMob ‚Üí ImportDescriptor ‚Üí Locator(URLString).

Path fidelity: preserve UNC, percent-encoding, and drive letters exactly (no normalization).

No filtering: all OperationGroups (AVX/AFX/DVE) must be captured, including filler effects, with parameters, keyframes, and external references.

Legacy compressed JSON rules are included for traceability, not as the main implementation path.

Writers must only consume canonical JSON ‚Äî never AAF or DB directly.

/src is scaffolding only, implementation must strictly follow /docs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The repo itself may contain errors, gaps, or incorrect assumptions. At this stage, all ideas, critiques, and observations are welcome, even if they challenge or contradict parts of the repo.

What I‚Äôd like from you now:

A pitch or proposal describing how you would proceed from here.

Suggestions, ideas, or architectural strategies to move the project toward a working prototype.

Inspirations you see from other open-source projects, industry standards, or commercial tools that might influence direction.

Creative thoughts about workflow, UX, or validation/testing approaches.

Absolutely no code at this stage ‚Äî just reasoning, planning, and conceptual guidance.

The goal is to gather diverse perspectives from different AIs, then compare their proposals before we move forward with actual implementation.
Copilot said: Certainly! Here‚Äôs a conceptual proposal and set
Certainly! Here‚Äôs a conceptual proposal and set of strategic recommendations for moving the aaf2resolve-spec project from ‚Äúwell-specified repository‚Äù toward a robust working prototype. This is structured as a pitch and planning memo, not code, and aims to surface architectural, workflow, and validation ideas relevant to your next phase.

Project Vision & Approach
aaf2resolve-spec proposes a clean, intermediary JSON-based pipeline for translating Avid AAF sequences into DaVinci Resolve-compatible FCPXML (1.13). This addresses a recurring pain point in post-production: reliably moving complex timelines (with effects, references, and media paths intact) between incompatible NLEs. The strict, canonical JSON model and rule-first approach are strengths, but also pose unique challenges for implementation discipline and ecosystem adoption.

1. Architectural Strategy
A. Strict Separation of Concerns
Parser/Extractor: Reads canonical JSON and validates structure/semantics against the schema. Does not ‚Äúinterpret‚Äù or ‚Äúfix‚Äù data ‚Äî only ensures fidelity and compliance.
Transformer: Implements traversal and effect extraction as described in /docs/inspector_rule_pack.md. Modular rule engine recommended.
Exporter: Serializes the transformed, validated data into FCPXML 1.13, with granular traceability to original JSON objects for auditing.
Validator: Standalone tool that can rapidly verify any JSON instance against the canonical schema and check for rule violations.
B. Plug-in/Rule Pack Architecture
Treat inspector rules as a plug-in system: new rules can be added, toggled, or composed for varying workflows (e.g., strict archival vs. editorial handoff).
Consider using a declarative rule language (e.g., JSONLogic, JSONata) or a minimal embedded DSL for traversal and mapping logic.
C. Test Data & Traceability
Every example and test must reference a given JSON instance, expected FCPXML output, and a ‚Äúdiff‚Äù log showing traversal and transformation steps.
Legacy compressed JSON support should be implemented as a compatibility/traceability module, not a core pathway.
2. Inspirations & Precedents
A. OpenTimelineIO (OTIO)
OTIO‚Äôs modular adapter-based design for interchange formats is a gold standard. The way it separates timeline data, media references, and effects is instructive.
OTIO‚Äôs extensive test suite and round-trip validation tools set a good precedent for this project.
B. AS-11/X1, IMF, and EBUCore
These standards maintain strict metadata fidelity and traceability. Their ‚Äúauthoritative-first‚Äù reference resolution, especially in the context of complex media graphs, offers lessons for your UMID resolution logic.
C. Commercial Conform Tools
Tools like EDL-X, X2Pro, and AATranslator show the importance of robust edge-case handling, clear error reporting, and ‚Äúwhat-you-see-is-what-you-get‚Äù validation for editors.
3. Workflow & UX Considerations
A. Golden Path: JSON In, FCPXML Out
The core CLI should accept a canonical JSON, validate it, and emit FCPXML, with detailed logs for any dropped or transformed data.
Provide a ‚Äúdry run‚Äù mode that outputs only a validation/traversal report for debugging.
B. Interactive Inspector
Consider a web-based inspector (e.g., React + Monaco Editor) that lets users load a JSON file, step through traversal rules, preview transformations, and see effect/UMID resolution in real time.
This would help editors and pipeline TDs understand and trust the conversion process.
C. ‚ÄúStrict Mode‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúEditorial Mode‚Äù
Allow toggling strict spec-compliance versus more pragmatic, editorial-oriented output (e.g., gracefully handling broken links, incomplete UMIDs, or unsupported effects).
4. Validation & Testing
A. Schema-First Testing
All JSON processed must pass schema validation before any transformation; failures are fatal or at least flagged as ‚Äúnon-canonical.‚Äù
Build a large, versioned corpus of test JSONs including edge cases, malformed inputs, and legacy compressed JSONs.
B. ‚ÄúRound-Trip‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiff‚Äù Tests
Where possible, generate FCPXML, import it into Resolve, export a new FCPXML, and compare for data loss or mutation.
Use automated diff tools to compare expected and actual outputs.
C. Rule Coverage Reports
Track which rules in /docs/inspector_rule_pack.md are exercised by which tests, to avoid untested logic.
5. Creative & UX Ideas
Effect Parameter Explorer: A tool to visualize all OperationGroups and their parameters, even fillers, to verify completeness.
Drag-and-Drop CLI/Web App: ‚ÄúDrop a JSON, get an FCPXML‚Äù with instant feedback on what was included, skipped, or flagged.
Traceability Tagging: Every output FCPXML element should include a traceable comment or attribute referencing the source JSON object for easy debugging.
Summary
Key recommendations:

Uphold ‚Äúspec-first‚Äù discipline: JSON is the only interface; never shortcut to AAF or FCPXML logic directly.
Modularize traversal and effect extraction as composable rule packs.
Build robust validation, diff, and visualization tools alongside the conversion logic.
Draw on OTIO and broadcast metadata standards for architectural inspiration.
Prioritize traceability and testability at every step.
This approach will maximize confidence, encourage adoption, and make maintenance/extension easier as the spec evolves or new edge cases emerge.

Let me know if you want deeper exploration on any of these points, or a more detailed proposed workflow!
